# Maintenance-EOS
The maintenace team requested an End of Shift application to document labor utilization. This Tkinter application is simplistic, which should support longevity and sustainability.

User Requirements:
  1. Longevity and sustainability
  2. Multiple accounts within the file simultaneously

The project began as an Excel Macro file hosted on SharePoint; however, the online functionality prevented multiple accounts active simultaneously.

Thus, I pivoted to the Tkinter module in Python to construct a GUI accessible from multiple accounts. Moreover, I did not utilize a database to ensure longevity and sustainability. Incorporating a database will limit the user; hence, all observations are documented in Excel via the openpyxl module.
